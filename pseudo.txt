How to get the Mask of the IP Address, is to analyze the slash to start.
Then, you need to convert the IP address and the mask that you got into binary to get the subnet mask.
Next, to get the subnet id you just simply copy all the odd numbers (number 1) in the mask.
After that, focus on the host id for you to get the minimum ip by just adding 1 to its value.
And for the maximum ip, just change the host id of the subnet mask into zeroes.
